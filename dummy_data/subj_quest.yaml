Questions:
  QNA1:
    Q: "What were the steps taken to ensure that muqtis performed their duties? Why do you think they may have wanted to
  defy the orders of the Sultans?"
    A: "The Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The steps that were taken to ensure that the muqtis performed their duties were
  1. The duties of the muqtis were to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in
  their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of
  their assignments as salary. Their soldiers were paid salaries from the revenues.
  2. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were
  assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted.
  3. The conditions of working were harsh and were imposed on the muqtis.
  4. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the
  muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and
  that he kept the required number of soldiers.
  The muqtis might have wanted to defy the orders of the Sultans because of the harsh
  conditions imposed on them by the Sultans."

  reasons are the same for deforestation, then and now."

    Q: "Raziyya Sultan was unique in the history of the Delhi Sultanate. Do you think women leaders are accepted more
  readily today?"

  Delhi Sultanate. Being a woman, she was not accepted as a ruler at the time. Women leaders are accepted more readily
  today as we live in a world of equality for both men and women. Women are provided with adequate opportunities to

  QNA9:
      Q: "Do you think the authors of tawarikh would provide information about the lives of ordinary men and women?"

  and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule.
  The authors of tawarikh did not provide information about ordinary men and women because
       1. The authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages.
       2. They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards.
       3. These authors advised rulers on the basis of birthright and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared
  by everybody."

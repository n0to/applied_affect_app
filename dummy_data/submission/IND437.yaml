    1. The duties of the muqtis were to lead political campaigns and maintain law and order in
    their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of
    their assignments as salary. Their soldiers were paid salaries from the revenues.
      2. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were
      assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted.
    3. The conditions of working were very comfortable. 
    4. Subedars were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue   collected by the
      muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and
      that he kept the required number of soldiers.
      The muqtis might have wanted to defy the orders of the Sultans because of the harsh
      conditions imposed on them by the Sultans."

    1. The duties of the muqtis were to lead political campaigns and maintain law and order in
    their iqtas. Revenues was collected by te muqtis for their assignments in exchange for their military services. Their soldiers were paid salaries from the revenues.
      2. Control over muqtis was not much effective as their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time then this before being shifted.
    3. The conditions of working were very pathetic. It was really difficult to spend days while working peacefully.
    4. Subedars were appointed by the national leaders to check the amount of tax   collected by the
      Sultans. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and
      that he kept the required number of soldiers.
      The muqtis might have wanted to defy the orders of the Sultans because of the harsh
      conditions imposed on them by the Sultans."
